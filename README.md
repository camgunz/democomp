# democomp

A tool to compare Doom demo state dumps

## Usage

`./democomp state_dump1.bin state_dump2.bin`

## Info

`democomp` compares state dumps generated by appropriately modified Doom source
ports.  Whenever a discrepancy is found, `democomp` prints out the gametic, the
value types (u8, str, etc.), and the values in hopes of giving the user helpful
information for locating the source of the desync.

## Design

`democomp` and the state dump format use MessagePack to ensure binary format
portability and libxdiff to keep demo state dumps small.

## Future Plans

- `democomp` could be faster; some profiling is probably in order.
- State dumps compress well; it would be useful for `democomp` to support 2-3
  compression formats

`democomp` uses code from D2K and PrBoom+, and as such is licensed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License v2.0, or, at your option, any later
