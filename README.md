# democomp

A tool to compare Doom demo state dumps

## Usage

`./democomp state_dump1.bin state_dump2.bin`

## Info

`democomp` compares state dumps generated by appropriately modified Doom source
ports.  Whenever a discrepancy is found, `democomp` prints out the gametic, the
value types (u8, str, etc.), and the values in hopes of giving the user helpful
information for locating the source of the desync.

## Design

`democomp` and the state dump format use MessagePack to ensure binary format
portability and libxdiff to keep demo state dumps small.  `democomp` will
compare file sizes and SHA-256 hashes in order to detect matching demos without
the in-depth comparison, greatly improving scan time (useful for automated
checking).

## Future Plans

- `democomp` could be faster; some profiling is probably in order.
- State dumps compress well; it would be useful for `democomp` to support 2-3
  compression formats
- Read the demo format from a configuration file
